ZeroPoint is an energy system for Rift and Minecraft 1.13. It is mainly an API and adds a generator as an example block. There are a few fundamental goals:

- **Provide a deflated environment**. RF and Forge Energy went through a massive power creep, to the point where base-level cables transferred thousands of RF/t and base-level batteries stored millions. This isn't conducive to a fun experience, so ZeroPoint is starting fresh.
- **Stay simple and easy to understand**. ZeroPoint exposes itself in energy per second instead of per tick, so you have a better sense of how long things really take. Ticks are great for computers to understand, but not as great for humans.
- **Keep capable without capabilities**. Capabilities aren't in Rift yet, so ZeroPoint adds its own structure for interactions. It will continue to be updated and improved while Rift develops.
